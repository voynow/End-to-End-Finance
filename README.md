#### My second attempt at creating a framework for doing data science in the finanace domain.

**08/08/2021** See repository https://github.com/voynow/Financial-Analysis-Deep-Learning for first attempt. 
In this repository, my goal is to expand upon the knowledge I have gained in the domains of finance, software engineering, data science, and machine learning to create a more professional and usable product, yielding informative results and applicable systems.

**08/26/2021** So far, there isn't much to see here. We have utilities to load and clean data, as well as utilities to build and train a basic neural network. Our baseline model was able to predict the direction of price change with an accuracy of ~53%. This is not great. Typically here we could iterate on more complex models and try to squeeze out a few more percentages, but that would only be a short term solution. Instead of continuing the modeling phase, let's take a step back and consider possible next steps with our long term goal in mind. If we want to build professional scale software, we can't rely on the Yahoo Finance API for all of our data needs. We need to build our own database.
