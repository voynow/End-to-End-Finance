# finance

My second attempt at creating a framework for doing data science in the finanace domain. 
See repository https://github.com/voynow/Financial-Analysis-Deep-Learning for first attempt. 
In this repository, my goal is to expand upon the knowledge I have gained in the domains of finance, software engineering, data science, and machine learning to create a more professional and usable product, yielding informative results and applicable systems.
